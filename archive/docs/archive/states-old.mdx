# States

You can use State Designer to create a tree of **states**.

If you're new to states, then this article will introduce you to states as a concept. For a more straight-forward guide to using states in State Designer, see the [States](/TODO) page under Usage.

Let's begin with a simple question, **what are states?**

## States in Theory

Any system, if it is capable of change, can be described as having one or more _states_.

States describe all possible ways that a system may be. For example, a light switch may be _up_ or _down_. A traffic light may be _red_, _yellow_, or _green_.

When representing a system, identifying the system's states can help you to represent that system more accurately. A system may be more complex than it initially seems: for example, a door may be _open_ or _closed_, but on closer consideration, it might also be _opening_ or _closing_.

A complex system may have many possible states. As we'll see in this article, the list may be simplified by organizing those states as a graph.

## States in Practice

States are a very common pattern in programming. In the examples below, we'll look how states are commonly used and represented in React components.

### Implicit states

The most common way of representing states is to not represent them at all. A component's _implicit_ states exist "between the lines" of the code.

```jsx
// Counter.js

import React from "react"

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button disabled={count <= 0} onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>
        -
      </button>
      <button disabled={count >= 10} onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        +
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

If we squint at the example above, we can see a counter with three possible states: _at minimum_, _at maximum_, and somewhere _between_.

When the count is at zero, the counter is in its _minimum_ state, and so the minus button is disabled. When the count is at ten, the counter is in its _maximum_ state, and so the plus button is disabled. When the count is _between_ the two, both buttons are enabled.

As a developer writes a component, they will often possess a clear, state-based mental model similar to the one just described. The code that they write is an expression of that model. However, by leaving the _model itself_ out of their code, they force any new reader into reconstructing that same model based on the evidence of the code itself.

Such work is difficult, error-prone and frustrating.

### Binary States

The most simple _explicit_ state is a binary state, such as _on_ and _off_. These are often represented using a boolean value.

```jsx
// App.jsx
import React from "react"

export default function Toggle() {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = React.useState(false)

  function toggleIsOn() {
    setIsOn(!isOn)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={toggleIsOn}>{isOn ? "On" : "Off"}</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In the example above, we could describe the `Toggle` component as having two states: _on_ and _off_. In the code, these states are implemented using the boolean value `isOn`.

When reading the code, we can interpret it as follows:

- When `isOn` is `true` then the toggle is _on_.
- When `isOn` is `false` then the toggle is _off_.

Note that this pattern is only half-explicit, as "off" does not appear in the code, but only implicitly as "not on".

### Named states

For more complex states, a developer may use a string value as the name of the current state.

```jsx
// Submit.jsx
import React from "react"

export default function Submit() {
  const [status, setStatus] = React.useState("initial")

  function handleSubmit() {
    setStatus("loading")

    fetch("https://reqres.in/api/users?delay=2")
      .then(() => setStatus("success"))
      .catch(() => setStatus("failure"))
  }

  const messages = {
    initial: "Submit",
    loading: "Loading...",
    success: "Success!",
    failure: "Please try again"
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={status === "loading"}>
        {messages[status]}
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In the example above, the current state (or `status`) drives two changes to the user interface. It determines the text displayed on the button and, in order to prevent the user from submitting twice, it also determines whether or not the button is disabled.

### Compound states

More "complex" components often have several separate implicit or explicit states. While independently defined, these states are _jointly_ depended upon by different parts of the component, leading to complex logic.

```jsx
// ShyTag.jsx
import React from "react"

export default function ShyTag() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false)
  const [isPeeking, setIsPeeking] = React.useState(false)

  return (
    <div>
      <div
        onMouseEnter={() => !isOpen && setIsPeeking(true)}
        onMouseLeave={() => !isOpen && setIsPeeking(false)}
        onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}
        style={{ opacity: isOpen ? 1 : 0.5 }}
      >
        {isOpen || isPeeking ? "Hello world" : "He..."}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In the example above, two independent binary states are used to describe four possible compound states: _open and peeking_, _open and not peeking_, _closed and peeking_, and _closed and not peeking_.

This is where the common patterns begin to break down.

## State Explosion

When a system's states are enumerated separately, as in the previous example, then each additional element multiplies its complexity.

In the previous example, the two binary states `isOpen` and `isPeeking` produced four possible combinations. Adding a third binary state, such as `isDarkMode`, would lead to eight possible combinations.

A "state explosion" occurs when the number of possible combinations makes a system difficult or impossible to represent.

# States in State Designer

In State Designer, a _state_ describes a possible way that a system may be.
