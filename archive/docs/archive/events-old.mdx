# Events

On this page, you'll learn about:

- what events are
- how to configure a machine's events
- how to trigger an event with the `send` method

## What are events?

In order for a machine's [state](definitions/state) to change, something needs to happen first. In State Designer, we use the term **event** to describe the thing that has happened.

You can declare events in your machine's [configuration](definitions/configuration) and you can trigger an event by sending the name of an event to the machine's [`send`](definitions/send) method.

Events can also be triggered [automatically](definitions/auto-event), but we'll cover that in the next section.

## Declaring Events

In a machine's [configuration](definitions/configuration), every events belongs to a [state](definitions/state)â€”either the machine's [root state](definitions/root-state) or any state in the machine's [state tree](definitions/state-tree).

## Sending Events

A machine receives events through its through its `send` method.

```js
send("EVENT_NAME", myPayload)
```

### Payload

When you `send` an event to a machine, you may also send along a value, called a "payload". This value can be of any type or structure.

```js
send("EVENT_NAME", myPayload)
```

If any event handler runs as a result of the `send` call, then that handler's conditions, results and actions will all receive the payload as their second argument.

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const { data, send } = useStateDesigner({
    data: { message: "Hello world" },
    on: {
      // highlight-start
      CHANGED_MESSAGE: (data, payload) => {
        data.message = payload
      },
      // highlight-end
    },
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.message}</h1>
      <input
        value={data.message}
        // highlight-next-line
        onChange={(e) => send("CHANGED_MESSAGE", e.target.value)}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```
