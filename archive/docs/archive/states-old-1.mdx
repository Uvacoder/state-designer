# States

In a State Designer machine, a state describes a specific status, mode, or other way that the overall system may be.

States serve two purposes: they allow events to be disabled

## `on`

An object containing the state's events.

```jsx
createState({
  initial: "stopped",
  states: {
    playing: {
      // highlight-start
      on: {
        PRESSED_STOP: { to: "stopped" },
      },
      // highlight-end
    },
    stopped: {
      // highlight-start
      on: {
        PRESSED_PLAY: { to: "playing" },
      },
      // highlight-end
    },
  },
})
```

If the machine receives a corresponding event while the state is active, then the machine will handle that event. In the example above, the machine will ignore the `TURN_ON` event unless its _stopped_ state is active.

## `onEnter`

An event handled when the state becomes active.

```jsx
createState({
  initial: "stopped",
  states: {
    playing: {
      // highlight-start
      onEnter: {
        do: () => console.log("Entered playing!"),
      },
      // highlight-end
      on: {
        PRESSED_STOP: { to: "stopped" },
      },
    },
    stopped: {
      on: {
        PRESSED_PLAY: { to: "playing" },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

In the example above, the machine will log `"Entered playing!"` to the console as soon as its _playing_ state becomes active.

**Note**: this property is not available on the root state.

## `onExit`

An event handled when the state is de-activated.

```jsx
createState({
  initial: "stopped",
  states: {
    playing: {
      on: {
        PRESSED_STOP: { to: "stopped" },
      },
    },
    stopped: {
      // highlight-start
      onExit: {
        do: () => console.log("Leaving stopped!"),
      },
      // highlight-end
      on: {
        PRESSED_PLAY: { to: "playing" },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

In the example above, the machine will log `"Leaving stopped!"` to the console as soon as its _stopped_ state ceases to be active.

**Note**: this property is not available on the root state.

## `onEvent`

An event handled whenever the machine handles any other event while the state is active.

```jsx
createState({
  data: {
    count: 0,
    changes: 0,
  },
  states: {
    reading: {
      // highlight-start
      onEvent: {
        do: (data) => data.changes++,
      },
      // highlight-end
      on: {
        CLICKED_MINUS: { do: (data) => data.count-- },
        CLICKED_PLUS: { do: (data) => data.count++ },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

In the example above, the machine will increment `data.changes` each time it receives either a `CLICKED_PLUS` or `CLICKED_MINUS` event.

## `async`

An asynchonous event to handle when the state becomes active.

```jsx
createState({
  initial: "idle",
  states: {
    idle: {
      on: {
        LOAD_DATA: { to: "loading" },
      },
    },
    loading: {
      // highlight-start
      async: {
        await: () => fetch("https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random"),
        onResolve: { to: "success" },
        onReject: { to: "error" },
      },
      // highlight-end
    },
    success: {},
    error: {},
  },
})
```

In the example above, when the machine enters the _loading_ state, it will attempt to fetch data from the URL provided. If the fetch promise resolves, then the machine will transition to the _success_ state. If the fetch promise encounters and error and rejects, then the machine will transition to the _error_ state.

## `initial`

The name of a state's initial child state.

```jsx
createState({
  initial: "turned_off",
  states: {
    turned_on: {
      // highlight-next-line
      initial: "dim",
      states: {
        dim: {
          on: { BRIGHTENED: { to: "normal" } },
        },
        bright: {
          on: { DIMMED: { to: "dim" } },
        },
      },
    },
    turned_off: {
      on: { TOGGLED: { to: "turned_on" } },
    },
  },
})
```

## `states`

An object containing the state's child states.

```jsx
createState({
  initial: "turned_off",
  states: {
    turned_on: {
      initial: "dim",
      // highlight-start
      states: {
        dim: {
          on: { BRIGHTENED: { to: "normal" } },
        },
        bright: {
          on: { DIMMED: { to: "dim" } },
        },
      },
      // highlight-end
    },
    turned_off: {
      on: { TOGGLED: { to: "turned_on" } },
    },
  },
})
```

Because state can have child states, a machine's states come together to form a _tree_ of states.

### Parallel States

States that have child states but do _not_ have an `initial` property are termed **parallel states**.

When a parallel state becomes active, _all_ of its child states will simultaneously become active.

### Branch States

States that have both child states and an `initial` property are termed **branch states**.

When a branch state becomes active, its initial state will also become active.

There are two exceptions to this rule:

- If the branch state has been active before, and if the transition was a direct transition to the state with a `previous` modifier, then its previously active state will become active again.
- If the branch state, and if the transition had a `restore` modifier, then its previously active state will become active again, and _all child states_ will likewise be restored to their previously active states.

**Note:** In both cases, transitioning to a child state will also activate its parent.

See [Transitions](/docs/transitions) for more on `previous` and `restore`.
