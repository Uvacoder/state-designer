At the heart of State Designer is the **state**. A state stores information about a user interface and controls how and when that information should change. It also provides tools to help you use the state in your project.

### Creating a State

To create a state, pass a **configuration** object to the [`useStateDesigner`](/docs/api/useStateDesigner) hook.

A state's configuration contains everything about the state: its initial data and all of its events, child states, and collections. We'll learn about each part of a state's configuration in the following articles.

> **Tip:** If you want to use the same state with more than one component, you can create a state with the [`createState`](/docs/api/useStateDesigner) function, then pass the state to the `useStateDesigner` hook. To learn more, check out the [`useStateDesigner`](/docs/api/useStateDesigner) article.

In the next article, we'll learn how to configure a state to respond to events.
