# Repeat Events

You can use a **repeat event** to run the same event automatically on a regular interval while a state is active. When the state becomes inactive, the interval will automatically end.

```jsx
repeat: {
  event: {
    do: () => console.log("tick!"),
    delay: 1
  }
}
```

The delay is measured in seconds. If you leave out the delay, the event will run on every animation frame.

```jsx
repeat: {
  event: {
    do: () => console.log("tick!"),
    delay: 1
  }
}
```

In both cases, the event's initial result will include the total duration of the event as well as the elapsed time since the last time it ran.

```jsx
repeat: {
  event: {
    do: (data, payload, result) => {
      console.log("It's been " + result.duration + " since this timer started.")
      console.log("It's been " + result.elapsed + " since this function last ran.")
      },
    delay: 1
  }
}
```
