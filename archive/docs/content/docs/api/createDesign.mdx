# `createDesign`

If you want to use the same design for multiple states, but still get the same TypeScript support while you construct the design object, you can use the `createDesign` function.

```js
const design = createDesign({ ... })
```

The `createDesign` function doesn't do anything special—it just returns the same object that you've passed to the function. Its only purpose is to provide type support as you construct a design.

However, having a separate design object might be useful in certain circumstances—and it's much easier to write a state with type support than without it.

```js
const design = createDesign({
  data: {
    score: 0,
    lives: 3,
  },
  on: { ... },
})

function createStateWithCustomScore(score) {
  return createState({
    ...design,
    data: {
      ...design.data,
      score,
    },
  })
}

function createStateWithCustomLives(lives) {
  return createState({
    ...design,
    data: {
      ...design.data,
      lives,
    },
  })
}
```
