# The Problem

As developers, our understanding of how a system works is often very different than the code that we write to implement that system.

This can lead to several problems.

1. As a system's complexity increases, so too does the _mental effort_ required to keep the system's model in mind.
2. New developers, unfamiliar with the system, must work backward from the code itself in order to _derive_ the system's model.
3. Communicating how a system works requires _separate documentation_: graphs, charts or descriptions that must be authored alongside the system's implementation.

In the sections below, I will use [React](https://reactjs.com) to demonstrate this pattern in several components of a user interface. I will then argue in favor of more explicit implementationsâ€”of which State Designer is one example.

## The Counter

Let's consider this counter.

An implementation in React might look like this:

```jsx
// counter.js

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)

  return (
    <Container>
      <Button
        ariaLabel="Minus"
        disabled={count === 0}
        onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}
      >
        -
      </Button>
      {count}
      <Button
        ariaLabel="Plus"
        disabled={count === 10}
        onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}
      >
        +
      </Button>
    </Container>
  )
}
```
