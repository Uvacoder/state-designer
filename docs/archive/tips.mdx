In State Designer, your `design` is a regular JavaScript object. This object contains everything there is to know about your state: its initial `data` value, a tree of state nodes with associated event handlers, and collections of functions that can be used across those event handlers.

You're free to use only the features you needâ€”or none at all!

```js
const state = useStateDesigner({})
```

Here's a very simple design:

```js
const state = useStateDesigner({
  initial: "notChecked",
  states: {
    notChecked: {
      on: { CHECKED: { to: "checked" } },
    },
    notChecked: {
      on: { CHECKED: { to: "notChecked" } },
    },
  },
})
```

Here's something more complex:

```js
const state = useStateDesigner({
  data: { seconds: 0 },
  initial: "stopped",
  states: {
    stopped: {
      on: {
        STARTED: { to: "running" },
        RESET: { unless: "timeIsZero", do: "resetTime" },
      },
    },
    running: {
      on: {
        STOPPED: { to: "stopped" },
        RESET: { do: "resetTime", to: "stopped" },
      },
      repeat: {
        onRepeat: "addSecond",
        delay: 1,
      },
    },
  },
  conditions: {
    timeIsZero(data) {
      return data.seconds === 0
    },
  },
  actions: {
    addSecond(data) {
      data.seconds++
    },
    resetTime(data) {
      data.seconds = 0
    },
  },
  values: {
    seconds(data) {
      return data.seconds % 60
    },
    minutes(data) {
      return Math.floor(data.seconds / 60)
    },
  },
})
```

You can create a state by passing the object to the [`createState`](/docs/api/createState) function (or to [`useStateDesigner`](/docs/api/useStateDesigner) in a React project). You can interact with the resulting state using the [`state`](/docs/api/state) API.

## Managing Complexity

A design object can become quite large and complex. State Designer helps manage this complexity in several ways:

- As shown above, you can create **collections** of `actions`, `conditions`, and other functions that can be referenced from your event handlers. This can ensure that your events and states remain readable while keeping your implementations easy to find.
- Instead of putting everything into "one big state," you can separate your application's logic into **multiple states** that communicate by sending events to one another. For example, in the [Todos](/examples/todos) project, each todo has its own local state that reports up to the global state when the todo changes.
- The library is written in **TypeScript** and, if your editor supports TypeScript in its Intellisense, you'll get plenty of help throughout the design object. (If you're not using TypeScr, you can add `// @ts-check` to the top of your file to get its suggestions).

## Code Goes Below the Fold

Although a state's design is about how a thing _works_, rather than how it _looks_, the design API does reward aesthetic sensibility. In the example above (and in all of the [examples](https://tutorials.state-designer.com/)) you may have noticed that the top half of a design is written in near-to-natural language, while the bottom half includes more codey-code.

You don't have to follow this pattern, but you might consider it. One of the best parts of working with State Designer is being able to _read through_ your state. Your implementations need to work, too, but they're often a separate problem.
