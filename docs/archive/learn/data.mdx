# Using Data

In a State Designer's configuration, you can use the `data` property to store any type of data that you'd like to keep track of.

> **Note:** The interactive examples on this page use the `useStateDesigner` hook from `@state-designer/react`.

Let's start with a very simple state configuration:

<LiveView snippet={"data"} />

In this example, we've defined our state's `data` property as an object with a property, `value`.

The `useStateDesigner` hook will return the current value of `data`. In the component's JSX, we're displaying `data.value` in a heading.

> In the playground above, can you set `data.value` to `"Hello world!"` instead?

**Hint:** You'll be creating a _string_ here, so be sure to include both quotes!
