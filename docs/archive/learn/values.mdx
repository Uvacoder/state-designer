# Values

Depending on what you're building, the values you're interested in might not be the same as the values that you store in `data`. To make this easier, you can add a `values` object to your configuration.

The `values` object is an object made up of functions that, like actions, accept the state's current `data`. Unlike actions, what matters here is what the function returns.

Each time the state is ready to update, it will run all of its `values` functions and return a new object—also named `values`—that contains whatever each function returned.
