# Transition Events

You can fire **transition events** automatically as you transition between states.

```jsx
onEnter: { do: () => console.log("Entered the state!") },
onExit: { do: () => console.log("Left the state!") },
onEvent: { do: () => console.log("Something happened while I was active!") }
```
