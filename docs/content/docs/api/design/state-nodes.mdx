# States

A design object supports a tree of states nodes (or "states") that can be either active or inactive. These states nodes serve two purposes: together with `data`, they represent the state of the user interface through which states are active and inactive; and, because events may only be handled on _active_ states, they provide a way to handle the same event differently under certain circumstances.

The design object describes the _root_ state node. Like any other state, this root state may have child states—and these states may have child states of their own, and so on.

All states support the same set of properties.

## `states`

A state's `states` property is an object containing the state's child states.

```js
const state = createState({
  states: {
    land: {},
    sea: {},
  },
})
```

States are a repeating pattern: the root state may have child states, and each of those child states may have their own child states, and so on to any depth.

```js
const state = createState({
  states: {
    land: {
      states: {
        walking: {},
        running: {},
      },
    },
    sea: {
      states: {
        swimming: {},
        diving: {},
      },
    },
  },
})
```

## `initial`

A state's `initial` property serves two purposes: it identifies this state as a _branch_ state, where only one of its child states may be active at a time, and it indicates which child state should be the "initially active" state. When the parent state becomes active, this initial child state will also become active, while all other child states will be inactive.

```js live=true log=true
const state = createState({
  id: "body",
  initial: "standing",
  states: {
    standing: {},
    sitting: {},
    walking: {},
  },
})

return log(state.active)
```

In the example above, the root state is a branch state, meaning that one only of its child states will be active at a time.

If the `initial` property is _not_ provided, then the state will be considered a _parallel_ state. In a parallel state, _all_ child states will be active simultaneously whenever the parent state is active.

```js live=true log=true
const state = createState({
  id: "body",
  states: {
    attitude: {
      initial: "happy",
      states: {
        happy: {},
        sad: {},
      },
    },
    pose: {
      initial: "standing",
      states: {
        standing: {},
        sitting: {},
        walking: {},
      },
    },
  },
})

return log(state.active)
```

In the example above, the root state is a parallel state, meaning that _both_ the `attitude` and `pose` states will be active at the same time. However, each of these states are branch states, and will only have one active child state each.

> **Tip:** If we didn't have parallel states, we would need to create separate states for `happyAndStanding`, `sadAndStanding`, `happyAndSitting`, and so on. As you can imagine, it wouldn't take much for this to become a major problem!

## `on`

A state's `on` property is an object that defines which _events_ the state can handle, as well as how the event should handle those events. These events are stored as properties of the `on` object, with the property's key being the event's _name_ and one or more _event handlers_ as the property's value.

```js
const state = createState({
  // highlight-start
  on: {
    WELCOMED: (data) => (data.message = "Hello world!"),
  },
  // highlight-end
})
```

Events in the `on` object describe things that can happen _outside_ of your state and that, when they occur, should produce some effect _inside_ of it. As far as your design is concerned, an event will "occur" when it is _sent_ to the state using the state's `send` method.

```js
const state = createState({
  data: {
    message: "...",
  },
  // highlight-start
  on: {
    BORN: (data) => (data.message = "Hello world!"),
  },
  // highlight-end
})

state.data.message // "..."
state.send("BORN")
state.data.message // "Hello world!"
```

There are two types of changes that an event may produce: a change to the state's `data` through an _action_, as shown in the example above, or a change to the state's active and inactive state nodes though a _transition_.

```js
const state = createState({
  initial: "low",
  states: {
    high: {},
    low: {},
  },
  // highlight-start
  on: {
    SET_HIGH: { to: "high" },
  },
  // highlight-end
})

state.isIn("high") // false
state.send("SET_HIGH")
state.isIn("high") // true
```

In your design, you can also define events that should happen _inside of_ your state, either automatically or as the result of some other event.

## `onEnter`

If a state has an `onEnter` event, then that event will be handled whenever the state changes from inactive to active as the result of a transition.

```js
const state = createState({
  data: { temperature: 18 },
  initial: "low",
  states: {
    high: {
      onEnter: (data) => (data.temperature = 30), // highlight-line
    },
    low: {},
  },
  on: {
    SET_HIGH: { to: "high" },
  },
})

state.data // { temperature: 18 }
state.send("SET_HIGH")
return log(state.data) // { temperature: 30 }
```

An `onEnter` will also occur when a state is first created. (One of the last things that the `createState` function does is to switch the root state from inactive to active.)

```js
const state = createState({
  data: { count: 0 },
  onEnter: () => data.count++,
})

state.data // { count: 1 }
```

> **Note:** Because an `onEnter` event's handler may produce its _own_ transition, it's possible to create a design that bounces indefinitely between two states.
>
> ```js
> const state = createState({
>   initial: "low",
>   states: {
>     // highlight-start
>     high: {
>       onEnter: { to: "low" },
>     },
>     low: {
>       onEnter: { to: "high" },
>     },
>     // highlight-end
>   },
>   on: {
>     SET_HIGH: { to: "high" },
>   },
> })
> ```
>
> A state will throw an error if it detects an infinite loop like this at runtime. Best to take care when using an transition in an internal event like `onEnter`.

## `onExit`

A state's `onExit` event will be handled whenever the state changes from active to inactive as the result of a transition.

```js
const state = createState({
  data: { exits: 0 },
  initial: "atHome",
  states: {
    atHome: {
      onExit: (data) => data.exits++,
    },
    outside: {},
  },
  on: {
    LEFT_HOUSE: { to: "outside" },
  },
})

state.data // { exits: 0 }
state.send("LEFT_HOUSE")
return log(state.data) // { exits: 1 }
```

> **Note:** An `onExit` event defined at the root of a design object will never run because a state's root state node will never become inactive.

## `onEvent`

A state's `onEvent` event will be handled whenever the state receives an event through its `send` method while that state is active. The event does not need to be handled elsewhere in order for the `onEvent` handler to run.

```js
const state = createState({
  data: { events: 0 },
  onEvent: (data) => data.events++,
})

state.data // { events: 0 }
state.send("RAISED")
state.send("LOWERED")
state.data // { events: 2 }
```

## `repeat`

A state's `repeat` property allows you to define an event, `onRepeat`, that will be handled on an interval while its state is active.

```js
const state = createState({
  data: { seconds: 0 },
  repeat: {
    onRepeat: (data) => data.seconds++,
    delay: 1,
  },
})

state.data // { seconds: 0 }
await twoSecondPause()
state.data // { seconds: 2 }
```

The `delay` property is optional: if you leave it out, the event will be handled on every [animation frame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame), or roughly sixty times per second.

```js live=true
function Timer() {
  const state = useStateDesigner({
    data: { frames: 0 },
    initial: "stopped",
    states: {
      stopped: {},
      running: {
        repeat: {
          onRepeat: { do: (data) => data.frames++ },
        },
      },
    },
    on: {
      STARTED: { to: "running" },
      STOPPED: { to: "stopped" },
    },
  })

  return (
    <Grid gap={2} columns="auto auto 1fr">
      <Button onClick={() => state.send("STARTED")}>Start</Button>
      <Button onClick={() => state.send("STOPPED")}>Stop</Button>
      <Heading as="h1">{state.data.frames}</Heading>
    </Grid>
  )
}
```

> **Tip:** If a design includes multiple event handlers that repeat on each frame, then these event handlers will be batched so that they produce at most one update per frame.

Updating a React component on every animation frame can lead to performance issues. The `useStateDesigner` hook updates each time the state notifies its subscribers, and a state notifies its subscribers any time that an action or transition occurs. However, you can use the `secretlyDo` and `secretlyTo` event handler properties to run actions and transition without triggering a notification—which will, in turn, prevent it from causing any component updates via `useStateDesigner`.

In the example below, the count will still update on each frame but, unlike the example above, the _component_ will only update when starting or stopping the timer.

```js live=true
function Timer() {
  const state = useStateDesigner({
    data: { frames: 0 },
    initial: "stopped",
    states: {
      stopped: {},
      running: {
        repeat: {
          onRepeat: { secretlyDo: (data) => data.frames++ },
        },
      },
    },
    on: {
      STOPPED: { to: "stopped" },
      STARTED: { to: "running" },
    },
  })

  return (
    <Grid gap={2} columns="auto auto 1fr">
      <Button onClick={() => state.send("STARTED")}>Start</Button>
      <Button onClick={() => state.send("STOPPED")}>Stop</Button>
      <Heading as="h1">{state.data.frames}</Heading>
    </Grid>
  )
}
```

## `async`

An `async` event allows you to make an asynchronous request and then handle the request differently depending on its outcome.

```js
const url = "https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random"

const state = createState({
  data: { events: 0 },
  async: {
    await: async function () {
      const response = await fetch(url)
      return response.json()
    },
    onResolve: (data, _, result) => {
      data.message = result.message
    },
    onReject: () => {
      data.message = "Result failed!"
    },
  },
})
```

The `async` property is an object with three properties: `await`, `onResolve`, and `onReject`.

The `await` property accepts either an [async function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) or a function that returns a promise. When the state becomes active, it will wait for this promise to either resolve or reject. If it resolves, then the state will run its `onResolve` event; otherwise, it will run its `onReject` event. Both event handlers will receive the resolved (or rejected) data as its initial `result`.

See the [this project](/examples/dogs) for a more complete example.
