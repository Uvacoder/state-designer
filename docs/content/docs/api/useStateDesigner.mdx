# useStateDesigner

```ts
useStateDesigner(source: state | config, dependencies?: any[]): state
```

The `useStateDesigner` hook will subscribe a component to a state's updates. Any time the state updates, so will the component.

You can use the hook in two different ways, depending on whether you want to subscribe a component to existing state or to a new state created just for the component.

## External State Pattern

If you pass `useStateDesigner` a **state** that you've created somewhere else (such as with [`createState`](/docs/api/createState)) then the hook will subscribe the component to the state's updates.

```jsx
import { createState } from "@state-designer/core"
import { useStateDesigner } from "@state-designer/react"

const counter = createState({ data: { count: 1 } })

function Example() {
  // highlight-next-line
  const state = useStateDesigner(counter)
  return <h1>{state.data.count}</h1>
}
```

You can use this pattern to subscribe multiple components all to the same state. In this way, you can use State Designer to create **global states** that drive updates to many parts of your project.

> **Tip:** A component does not have to be _subscribed_ to a state in order to use the state's `send` method to send it events. [See an example](https://codesandbox.io/s/using-send-method-withput-subscribing-sp6bw).

## Internal State Pattern

You can also pass `useStateDesigner` a **configuration object** instead. In this case, the hook will use the config to create a _new_ state and then subscribe to its updates.

```jsx
import { createState } from "@state-designer/core"
import { useStateDesigner } from "@state-designer/react"

function Example() {
  // highlight-next-line
  const state = useStateDesigner({ data: { count: 1 } })
  return <h1>{state.data.count}</h1>
}
```

This pattern is useful for inputs, buttons, and other reusable components that each require their own **local states**.

### Dependencies

If you're using the internal state pattern, you can pass the `useStateDesigner` hook a second argument: an array of dependencies. If the hook finds changes in these dependencies between renders, it will rebuild a new state based on the current config.

```jsx
function Counter({ count = 1 }) {
  // highlight-next-line
  const state = useStateDesigner(
    {
      data: { count },
      on: { CLICKED: (data) => data.count++ },
    },
    [count]
  )
  return <h1>{state.data.count}</h1>
}
```

In the example above, another component could control the Counter component through its `count` prop. When that prop changed, the hook would rebuild a new state with the correct `data.count`.

That this is a rather heavy-handed solution and may not be appropriate for complex states, especially those with a mix of controlled and uncontrolled values as in the example below. In these cases, you could achieve the same result with effects that send events to the state.

```jsx
function Counter({ count = 1 }) {
  // highlight-next-line
  const state = useStateDesigner({
    data: {
      count,
      hovers: 0,
    },
    on: {
      CLICKED: (data) => data.count++,
      HOVERED: (data) => data.hovers++,
      UPDATED_FROM_PROPS: (data, payload) => (data.count = payload),
    },
  })

  React.useEffect(() => {
    state.send("UPDATED_FROM_PROPS", count)
  }, [count])

  return <h1>{state.data.count}</h1>
}
```

In the example above, another component could still control `data.count` through its `count` prop, however the hook would not rebuild its state and so would preserve its `data.hovers`.

## Passing State to Children

In most cases, you can use props to pass down parts of a state to a component's children.

```jsx
function Parent() {
  const { data } = useStateDesigner({ ... })
  return <Child someProp={data.foo}/>
}

function Child(props) {
  return <div>{props.someProp}</div>
}
```

You might also want to pass down the state's `send` method. This method is stable and can be used the same manner as the `dispatch` method described [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-avoid-passing-callbacks-down).

```jsx
function Parent() {
  const { send } = useStateDesigner({ ... })
  return <Child send={send}/>
}

function Child(props) {
  return <button onClick={() => props.send('SOME_EVENT')}/>
}
```

### Subscribing Children to State

You may sometimes want to subscribe a component's child directly to same state as the parent. This is easily done if both components are using the external state pattern.

```jsx
import counter from "./counter"

function Parent() {
  const { data } = useStateDesigner(counter)
  return <Child />
}

function Child(props) {
  const { send } = useStateDesigner(counter)
  return <button onClick={() => send("SOME_EVENT")} />
}
```

You can subscribe a component to its parent's internal state, too. When using the internal state pattern, pass down the state returned by the `useStateDesigner` hook. Other components can then subscribe to this state using the external state pattern.

```jsx
function Parent() {
  const localState = useStateDesigner({ ... })
  return <Child state={localState}/>
}

function Child({ state }) {
  const { send } = useStateDesigner(state)
  return <button onClick={() => send("SOME_EVENT")} />
}
```

## Note on Mutability

The state returned from `useStateDesigner` is a mix of immutable and mutable data. Each update returned from the hook is a new object comprised of the source state's immutable `data`, `active`, and `stateTree` properties, together with the source state's original stable methods, such as `send`, `isIn`, and `onUpdate`.
