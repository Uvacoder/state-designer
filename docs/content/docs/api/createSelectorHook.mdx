# useStateDesigner

```js
const useSelector = createSelectorHook(state)
```

This is a helper that will generate a selector hook from a state. Unlike the library's regular `useSelector` hook, the hook returned by `createSelectorHook` does not require you to provide the state as a first argument.

```js
import { createState, createSelectorHook } from '@state-designer/react'

const state = createState({ ... })

const useSelector = createSelectorHook(state)
```

See the `useSelector` article for more on how to use selectors.
