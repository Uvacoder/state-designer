# State

This article describes the state API.

You can create a state by passing a [design](/docs/api/design) object to the [`createState`](/docs/api/createState) function—or, in a React project, the [`createStateDesigner`](/docs/api/useStateDesigner) hook. Once you've created a state, you can use and interact with it using the values and methods described below.

### What is a State?

A `state` manages information about the state of a user interface. It stores the current version of that information and controls when and how it can change. When the information does change, a `state` can notify other parts of your project so that everything stays in sync.

The core of the state object is the snapshot of the state's current information:

- [`data`](/docs/api/state#data)
- [`active`](/docs/api/state#active)
- [`values`](/docs/api/state#values)
- [`stateTree`](/docs/api/state#state-tree)

It also contains several helpers to interpret that information:

- [`isIn`](/docs/api/state#is-in)
- [`isInAny`](/docs/api/state#is-in-any)
- [`whenIn`](/docs/api/state#whenIn)

It also contains a function that you can use to send events to the state:

- [`send`](/docs/api/state#send)

And a function to subscribe to its changes:

- [`onUpdate`](/docs/api/state#on-update)

---

## `data`

The `data` property corresponds to the design's `data` property, except that `state.data` will always store the most recent version of the `data`.

```js live=true log=true
const state = createState({
  data: { count: 2 },
})

return log(state.data)
```

When an event occurs that changes the state's `data`, the `data` property will store the latest version.

```js live=true log=true
const state = createState({
  data: { count: 2 },
  on: { INCREASE: (data) => data.count++ },
})

state.send("INCREASE")
return log(state.data)
```

The `data` value is immutable: it will be new after each change. Its _properties_ will only be new if those properties have changed during the update.

```js live=true log=true
const state = createState({
  data: {
    user: {
      name: "Steve",
      age: 93,
    },
    count: 4,
  },
  on: {
    INCREASE: (data) => data.count++,
    AGE: (data) => data.user.age++,
  },
})

const { data } = state

state.send("INCREASE")
// state.send("AGE")

return log({
  dataIsNew: state.data !== data,
  userIsNew: state.data.user !== data.user,
})
```

## `values`

The `values` property contains the state's current computed values. This object corresponds to the design object's [`values`](/api/design#values) object, except that the `state.values` object contains the results of the design's functions.

```js live=true log=true
const state = createState({
  data: { count: 2 },
  values: {
    double(data) {
      return data.count * 2
    },
    lastUpdated() {
      return new Date().toLocaleTimeString("en-gb")
    },
  },
})

return log(state.values)
```

Whenever the state updates, it will re-compute its `values` by running each function again. Like `data`, this object will be new after each update.

```js live=true log=true
const state = createState({
  data: { count: 2 },
  on: {
    INCREASE: (data) => data.count++,
  },
  values: {
    double(data) {
      return data.count * 2
    },
  },
})

const initial = state.values
state.send("INCREASE")
return log([initial, state.values])
```

## `isIn`

The `isIn` function will return `true` if the indicated state is currently active.

```js
const state = createState({
  initial: "high",
  states: {
    high: {
      on: { TOGGLE: { to: "low" } },
    },
    low: {
      on: { TOGGLE: { to: "high" } },
    },
  },
})

state.isIn("high") // true
state.send("TOGGLE")
state.isIn("high") // false
```

### Using Paths

You can indicate a state node with either its name or its path.

```js
state.isIn("active")
state.isIn("bold.active")
state.isIn("text.bold.active")
```

> **Tip:** Technically, the state's name is a path with a depth of only one. A state's path is made up of its parent states, separated by periods. A full path might look something like `#state_id.root.text.bold.active`.
>
> Indicating states with paths is useful when your design includes multiple states that share the same name, such as `bold.active` and `italic.active`.

### Testing Multiple States

You can also use the `isIn` method to test if more than one state is active. When testing multiple states, the method will return `true` only if _all_ of the indicated states are active.

```js
const state = createState({
  initial: "high",
  states: {
    high: {},
    low: {},
    med: {},
  },
})

state.isIn("low", "med") // false
state.isIn("high", "low") // false
state.isIn("high", "root") // true
```

## `isInAny`

The `isInAny` method works exactly like `isIn` except that when testing multiple states it will return `true` if _any_ of the indicated states are active.

```js
const state = createState({
  initial: "high",
  states: {
    high: {},
    low: {},
    med: {},
  },
})

state.isIn("low", "med") // false
state.isIn("high", "low") // true
// highlight-next-line
state.isIn("high", "root") // true
```

## `whenIn`

The `whenIn` helper method allows you to return different values depending on which states are active.

```js
buttonText = state.whenIn({
  stopped: "Play",
  playing: "Stop",
}) // "Play"

state.send("PLAYED") // Transition to `playing`

buttonText = state.whenIn({
  stopped: "Play",
  playing: "Stop",
}) // "Stop"
```

### Using Paths

As with `isIn`, you can indicate a state using a path of any depth.

```js
state.whenIn({
  heading: "H1",
  "text.subheading": "H2",
  "editing.text.body": "Body",
})
```

### Output

By default, the `whenIn` helper will return a value. If multiple indicated states are active, then this value will be the last active state indicated.

```js
state.whenIn({
  asleep: "Asleep",
  awake: "Awake", // Active
  working: "Working", // Active
}) // "Working"
```

You can use the method's second argument to produce different results. This argument is `"value"` by default, but you can also set it to `"array"`.

```js
state.whenIn(
  {
    asleep: "Asleep",
    awake: "Awake", // Active
    working: "Working", // Active
  },
  "array"
) // ["Awake", "Working"]
```

You can also set it to a reducer function. In this case, you can provide the reducer's initial value as the function's third argument.

```js
state.whenIn(
  {
    asleep: "Asleep",
    awake: "Awake", // Active
    working: "Working", // Active
  },
  (acc, cur) => acc + " and " + cur,
  "I'm "
) // "I'm Awake and Working"
```

> **Tip:** In React, you can use the `whenIn` helper to return different JSX depending on the currently active state(s). When using the `"array"` format, remember to add a unqiue [`key` property](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys) to each element.
>
> ```jsx
> <ul>
>   {whenIn({
>     asleep: <li key="0">Asleep</li>,
>     awake: <li key="1">Awake</li>,
>     working: <li key="2">Working</li>,
>   })}
> </ul>
> ```

## `active`

The `active` property contains an array of paths for all active states.

```js
const state = createState({
  initial: "high",
  states: {
    high: {
      on: { TOGGLE: { to: "low" } },
    },
    low: {
      on: { TOGGLE: { to: "high" } },
    },
  },
})

state.active // ["#state_id.root", "#state.id_root.high"]
```

## `stateTree`

The `stateTree` property includes the full tree of all state nodes.

```js
const state = createState({
  initial: "high",
  states: {
    high: {
      on: { TOGGLE: { to: "low" } },
    },
    low: {
      on: { TOGGLE: { to: "high" } },
    },
  },
})

// Print the entire state tree
console.log(
  JSON.stringify(
    state.stateTree,
    (k, v) => (typeof v === "function" ? v.name : v),
    2
  )
)
```

> **Tip:** For now, at least, this object is mutable—but for heaven's sake, don't mutate it! Use it instead for debugging, visualization, and to better understand the relationship between a state design and the resulting state tree.

## `onUpdate`

You can subscribe to a state's changes by passing a callback function to the state's `onUpdate` method. When a state changes, it will call each subscribed callback with itself as the only argument.

> **Note:** The state passed to the callback is the same as (or strictly equal to) the state that was originally subscribed to. Its methods, such as `send` will also be the same. However, the state will have new `data` and `active` properties following each update.
>
> ```js
> const state = createState(myDesign)
>
> const { data, active, send } = state
>
> state.onUpdate((update) => {
>   console.log(update === state) // true
>
>   // Compared with state values
>   console.log("data", update.data === state.data) // true
>   console.log("active", update.active === state.active) // true
>   console.log("send", update.send === state.send) // true
>
>   // Compared with destructured values
>   console.log("data", update.data === data) // false
>   console.log("active", update.active === active) // false
>   console.log("send", update.send === send) // true
> })
> ```

The `onUpdate` method returns a second function that will cancel the subscription.

```js
const state = createState(myDesign)

cancel = state.onUpdate((update) => {
  // Do something
})

cancel()
```

> **Tip:** You could use this to cleanup a subscription that you've made in an effect:
>
> ```jsx
> const state = createState(myDesign)
>
> function Example() {
>   const [state, setState] = React.useState()
>
>   React.useEffect(() => {
>     return state.onUpdate((update) => setState(update.data))
>   }, [])
>
>   return <div>...</div>
> }
> ```
>
> The [`useStateDesigner`](/docs/api/useStateDesigner) hook takes care of this for you, though!
